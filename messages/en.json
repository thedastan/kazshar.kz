		"production_des": "Our plant uses advanced technologies to manufacture high-quality products. The process includes several key stages:",
		"production_des2": "Our process ensures maximum efficiency and impeccable quality, meeting even the most stringent standards.",

		"process": "Raw Material Preparation",
		"process_des": "At this stage, all incoming materials are received, identified, and inspected: rolled metal, alloying additives, molding mixtures, and other components.\nEach batch undergoes incoming quality control for chemical composition, physical and mechanical properties, and compliance with technical specifications. Only verified raw materials are allowed for further production.",

		"process2": "Casting and Forging",
		"process_des2": "Main blanks and components are formed here:\n• forged and cast grinding balls,\n• crusher cones,\n• excavator teeth,\n• other parts for mining and construction equipment.\nThe process includes induction or arc heating, forging on presses, or pouring molten metal into sand or chill molds followed by cooling. Both automatic lines and manual molding are used for complex parts.",

		"process3": "Machining",
		"process_des3": "After thermal stabilization, the parts undergo processing, including:\n• turning and milling,\n• grinding and boring,\n• heat treatment (hardening, normalization),\n• removal of sprues and burrs.\nPrecise geometry, fits, threads, and working surfaces are shaped at this stage.",

		"process4": "Assembly and Product Preparation",
		"process_des4": "Finished components are assembled into units or supplied separately according to the order.\nIf necessary, welding, installation of fastening elements, painting, or application of protective coatings is performed.\nAll equipment undergoes final inspection before packaging.",

		"process5": "Quality Control",
		"process_des5": "Multi-level control is implemented at every production stage:\n• visual inspection,\n• dimensional checks and tolerances,\n• non-destructive testing (ultrasound, magnetic-particle inspection),\n• tests for hardness, strength, impact toughness, and wear resistance.\nProducts comply with GOST, ISO, and internal company standards.",

		"process6": "Packaging and Shipment",
		"process_des6": "Finished products are labeled and packed into big bags, metal barrels, pallets, or containers depending on customer requirements.\nAccompanying documents, quality passports, and certificates are prepared.\nWe deliver across the CIS, Asia, and Europe by road and rail.",

		"gallery": "Equipment Used",

		"controll": "Quality Control",
		"controll_des": "Our specialists use modern equipment and high-precision tools to ensure strict compliance with quality standards at each stage.",

		"quality": "Raw Material Inspection",
		"quality_des": "Each batch of incoming raw materials (including rolled metal and alloying components) undergoes mandatory laboratory testing for compliance with chemical composition and standards.\nThe 'Iskraline-100' spectrometer is used to precisely determine carbon, manganese, silicon, and other elements in alloys. This prevents deviations from the formula and ensures consistent product quality from the start.",

		"quality2": "Casting and Forging Control",
		"quality_des2": "During casting and forging, each batch undergoes visual and instrumental control. Assessed are:\n• shape integrity,\n• absence of cracks and cavities,\n• metal density and structure.\nSelected items are also hardness tested at an early stage to identify any heat treatment discrepancies before machining.",

		"quality3": "Machining and Measurements",
		"quality_des3": "After receiving blanks, high-precision turning, milling, or grinding is performed.\nEach item is checked against technical documentation and drawings using micrometric tools and control gauges. Special attention is paid to fit sizes, concentricity, and surface roughness.",

		"quality4": "Final Inspection and Testing",
		"quality_des4": "Before packaging, products undergo final checks:\n• Brinell or Rockwell hardness testing using the 'TEMP-2' device,\n• wear resistance and impact strength tests (if required),\n• visual inspection and comparison with quality passports.\nAll data is logged and stored in the database to track the history of each batch.",

		"quality5": "Quality Analysis and Improvement",
		"quality_des5": "To continuously improve reliability and durability, our laboratory conducts:\n• regular internal audits of production processes,\n• analysis of defect and deviation statistics,\n• implementation of new control and improvement methods based on test results.\nAdditionally, we work with raw material suppliers and modernize production equipment based on quality analytics."
